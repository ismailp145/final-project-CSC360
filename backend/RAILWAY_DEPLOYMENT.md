# Railway Deployment Guide for .NET Backend

This guide will help you deploy your .NET backend to Railway.

## Prerequisites

1. A Railway account (sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app))
2. Your code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
3. A PostgreSQL database (you can provision one on Railway)

## Step 1: Set up Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Choose the `backend/SocalAPI` directory as the source

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In your Railway project dashboard, go to the "Variables" tab and add the following environment variables:

### Required Variables:
```
ConnectionStrings__PostgresConnection=your_postgres_connection_string
Jwt__Key=your_jwt_secret_key
Jwt__Issuer=https://your-app-name.railway.app
Jwt__Audience=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### Optional Variables:
```
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
PORT=8080
```

## Step 3: Set up PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Once created, go to the PostgreSQL service
4. Copy the connection string from the "Connect" tab
5. Add it to your environment variables as `ConnectionStrings__PostgresConnection`

## Step 4: Deploy

1. Railway will automatically detect your .NET project and start building
2. The build process will:
   - Install .NET SDK
   - Restore dependencies
   - Build the project
   - Start the application

## Step 5: Run Database Migrations

After deployment, you need to run your Entity Framework migrations:

1. Go to your deployed service in Railway
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Find your latest deployment
4. Click on the deployment and go to "Logs"
5. Add a custom command to run migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

## Step 6: Update Frontend Configuration

Update your frontend to use the new Railway URL:

```typescript
// In your frontend API service
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app-name.railway.app';
```

## Step 7: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Railway app URL: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
2. Test the health check endpoint: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/api`
3. Test your API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failures**: Check the build logs in Railway dashboard
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure your connection string is correct
3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure all required variables are set
4. **Port Issues**: Railway automatically sets the PORT environment variable

### Useful Commands:

```bash
# Check Railway CLI (if installed)
railway status

# View logs
railway logs

# Connect to your service
railway connect
```

## Monitoring

- Railway provides built-in monitoring and logging
- Check the "Metrics" tab for performance data
- Use the "Logs" tab to debug issues

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your Railway project settings
2. Click "Custom Domains"
3. Add your domain and configure DNS

## Cost Optimization

- Railway offers a free tier with limitations
- Monitor your usage in the "Usage" tab
- Consider upgrading if you exceed free tier limits

## Security Notes

- Never commit sensitive data like connection strings to your repository
- Use Railway's environment variables for all secrets
- Regularly rotate your JWT keys
- Enable HTTPS (Railway provides this automatically)
